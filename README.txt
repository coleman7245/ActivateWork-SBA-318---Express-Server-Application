Express Server Application by Derek Coleman

This is a simple Express server application tha allows a client to GET, POST, PATCH, and DELETE video game information. 
The basic data involves video game companies, titles, and genres. The routes are created in seperate files that allow for the 
aforemetioned client functions. Middleware is used that checks for errors and prevents duplicate data. EJS is used to render the 
HTML and a form is dispensed to allow the user to interact with the server.
